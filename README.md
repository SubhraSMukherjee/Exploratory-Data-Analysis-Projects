## EDA Projects
---
This repository (folder space really) collects the Author' Exploratory data Analysis(EDA) Projects

EDA projects are mostly done on excel/sheets (with some SQL aggregations), largely without any sort of statistical modelling or ML algorithms
### Structure
---
Every Subfolder is an standalone project with 3 components
1. `Problem Statement` : This is the detailed problem statement for which the Analysis is being run
2. `Raw Data` : The Raw Data supplied with the Problem Statement
3. `Recommendation & Insights`  : The Final Presentation encapsulating the Recommendations/Insights. Meant for a Business Audience
